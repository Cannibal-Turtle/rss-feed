        <![CDATA[1v1 with an obsessed ML, amazing FL who loves obedient wolfdogs.

FL has a system who brings her to do tasks. I don’t know what she gets after completing them tbh as it isn’t really explained? But FL has different tasks in each world. Initially she was the cannon fodder meant to help the villains, then it became fulfilling the wishes of the people who she transmigrated into, or completing tasks from the System.

Every arc is different but FL remains OP in all of them. She gets a special benefit from the System, a gold finger that she uses to help her in that world. FL is also really smart and manipulative, a top tier green tea lady. Oftentimes her true personality takes over the people she transmigrated into - haughty but not arrogant, green tea, smart, mischievous, sneaky. She’s never demure tbh. She also especially loves obedient men who look weak but with abs haha.

As for the ML, even if he has different personalities in each world, he has certain traits that’s always there — he is obsessed with the FL, can be a green tea or a stoic tough guy.

I just really enjoyed reading every world but after some point the worlds were reaaaally similar so I stopped for a while.

The 1v1 part:

[spoiler]One thing is, even if it isn’t explicitly mention — it’s definitely the same ML whom the FL met in her real world. I skipped to the end to see and I was right.[/spoiler]]]>

        <![CDATA[Rated 5 Stars because currently it's 3.7 and I think that's too low. Otherwise, I think it should be about 4.0 or 4.1

It's not a masterpiece but honestly it's pretty satisfying. I'm about to start Arc 4 and the past 3 arcs had interesting plots if a little cliché:
<ul>
 	<li>High school plot with mafia family subplot (strange, yes, but I find it amusing for a QT)</li>
 	<li>Concubine in Ancient China</li>
 	<li>Modern Entertainment Industry with a "stand-in" lover</li>
</ul>
Since it's quick transmigration, it can't be too complicated or else it won't be resolved quickly. I think relatively "dumb" antagonists are to be expected in these kinds of stories so it's best to adjust expectations.

Female Lead gets buffs in every world due to customer service (I mean... The System) but it's not world breaking (i.e. no fantasy elements in modern settings unless it's specifically urban fantasy). Mostly the buffs just help her change her Cannon Fodder Fate but she still has to work for it. FL seems like she has good time management skills.

Her personality is straightforward which I appreciate. Like the romance isn't her focus but she admits that she tends to be lascivious, so she hooks up with ML a lot.

She's very "faithful" though? Like so far, although she chases male idols, she doesn't really have sex with or start a relationship with anyone other than the ML for the arc. Anyways, I appreciate her three views.

I get story fatigue so I'm gonna stop reading here for now. I hope the Author maintains the quality for future arcs and I'm looking forward to reading everything!]]>

        <![CDATA[I'm only at the first arc, currently in ch 46, she already completed her mission and she stays in the world not like other qt that after the mission completed, it immediately transfers the mc to another world.

I WAS LOVING IT, until it just became boring to me. She's a rich girl, why does she have to pretend to be poor, and it's infuriating because she allows others to belittle her and it's frustrating. Like girl make your damn move, but she doesn't or she does? But it's too slow and its dragging out, specially the romance, mind you she's a quite rich person too before having the system, but she acts like that.

The way she acts and does doesn't sit right to me, might be because I expected too much of her being intelligent, she's of course intelligent but I guess I read too many much better than her.

Also the fact that this isn't completely translated yet, and the complete chapters for this novel is 1000+ makes me want to marinate this novel and I might comeback to reread this.]]>

        <![CDATA[This was a freaking masterpiece. I loved every moment of reading this and binged it in two weeks (there’s 1,000+ chapters). Except for two stories/worlds that I skipped because I wasn’t into the setting, everything else was well written and I fell in love with each character and ML (spoiler: it’s the same ML in different fonts). So sad when I got to the last chapter <img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" /> but it was a happy ending.]]>

        <![CDATA[If you check my history, I've started reading Chinese novels during the pandemic which is almost 5 years ago (omg) but, never NEVER have I ever finished a novel more than 700 chapters where most of the time I would just skim through them in some parts but yo, this novel, wow. I actually read a novel with 1188 chapters. A feat I never thought I would want or even dare to achieve (yes I cannot be like some of you here and I am very much aware my attention span is whack).  There's just something in this QT that just makes me want to read more.

Now back to the novel, every world can be a standalone novel on its own. They are all interesting concepts though I admit some are a bit cliche, some are a bit weird [spoiler]like that 2 brothers world[/spoiler] but how the FL deals with everything in a calm manner is excellent and even so, still retain to be likeable to readers. You can see she plans things well to reach her goals. I also like the fact that in between worlds, there is something going on behind the scene in the world station whatever that makes me curious everytime she completes a mission. I would have wanted more extras for the worlds but it's fine, I am already satisfied.

I highly recommend it, I might even read some of the worlds again one of these days but yeah. Very very nice. If anything, everyone should always have martial arts skills every time.]]>

        <![CDATA[Will list all the worlds below in order xx, may not finish tho

[spoiler]World One: The Heiress Will Not be a Cannon Fodder. Chapter 1-50, HE. Shes a rich businessman's daughter, and the OGbody bullied the ML, while her job is to make sure he doesnt 'blacken'. This was cute asff, they grew old together<img alt="😩" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f629.png" style="height: 1em;" />, 10/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Two: The Humble Concubine Will Not be a Cannon Fodder. Chapter 51-94, HE. Shes married to a trash man who uses her as a shield for his concubine, and her mission is to make him fall in love and then completely break his heart. The ML, disguised as female, is the trash man's main wife lol. She questioned his sexual orientation too many times since he was a 'girl' LMAO 7.5/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Three: The Stand-in Lover Will Not be a Cannon Fodder. Chapter 95-139, HE. Everyone thinks ML is using her as a 'stand-in' (plot twist, false rumours that he was so shocked to even know existed<img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" />).  I thought I wouldnt like ML or this story, but it turned out to be a really good one, and ML is <em>TEWW</em> cute and funny asf hhhshs. The mission is simple in this, to just stand firm and strong, and not let others look down on her--it allowed her freedom, which is probably why I liked it. 9.5/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Four: Disfigured Girlfriend Will Not be a Cannon Fodder. Chapter 140-176, HE. In a world of zombie apocalypse, Ogbody was disfigured and her trash bf left her for his 'moonlight'. Her mission is to be independent, and repay the only person in her life who helped her (ML). loll, when ML first met her and kept calling her ugly in his mind cuz he thought she had bad intentions<img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" />. Note, this isnt the zombie king from the synopsis (i assume because ML wasnt a zombie king, unsure tho) 6.5/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Five: The Village Girl Will Not be a Cannon Fodder. Chapter 177-220, HE. The ogbody was in love with a city boy, but her cousin secretly used her because the cousin too liked the boy, in the end resulting in ogbody marrying a trash abusive husband. Her mission is to be self-reliant, take care of her family, and take revenge on the cousin and the abusive husband of the past. This story is too cute >v<...I love the pair up of ML this time, who wouldnt like a strong, sexy greenflag military man🫦? One of my favs, 10/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Six: The Fake Daughter Will Not be a Cannon Fodden. Chapter 221-263, HE. The ogbody was the swapped fake daughter, and was treated like shittt from her 'family' (married off against her will to 'pay them back' for raising her, public humiliating, etc..) after the real daughter was found. Her mission is to break relation with the 'family' and save the person she was married off to (ML) from supernatural evils. This family got me wanting to chew my insides and spit it at them like leave her aloneee. PS. This world has some supernatural elements. 7/10[/spoiler]

PS: From this point on, some of the missions change from: 'The wishes of the cannon fodder ogbody' into 'whatever the system arranges', which is why the world title format also changes

[spoiler]World Seven: I Abused the Lord of the Blood Clan. Chapter 264-302, HE. Ogbody is a bloodhunt who abuses her slave, a vampire (ML). Her mission is to follow the plot and keep up with the actions of the ogbody (lol the loopholes she keeps finding....the line: 'he was tortured all night'. ML, who was tied up but MC wouldnt kiss or do anything, restraining the urge to take the first step: i feel tortured. Haha, mission complete<img alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2705.png" style="height: 1em;" />! he was tortured all night!) 7.5/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Eight: I gave the Demon God a Love Tribulation. Chapter 303-337, BE-HE. Xianxia setting. The demon god is having a tribulation, and ogbody is a stone demon another man in the tribulation has as a pet----Her mission is to give the demon god a love tribulation, which many fairies and goddesses, and also ogbody, failed to do. Tribulation is BE, final ending is HE. The tribulation ending made me feel so bitter lol. rating this a bit high cuz i was tired of them happy ass endings, but i still have mixed feelings since ML is pushy asf...cuz why he fighting himself (spoiler: the other parts of his soul...<img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" />) 8.5/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Nine: The Fiancé is Not Pitiful. Chapter 338-376, HE. This is set in a mecha (mechanic) world, the ogbody is from a wealthy but status-less family, engaged to a disabled man who later-on destroy the mecha world and her family due to ogbody's abusive treatment of him. The mission is to protect her family (who i LOVEEE btw xx). lol, whitelotus (FL) x whilelotus (ML) trope, a bit fast-paced. 7/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Ten: Flirting with the Conservative Feudal Warlord. Chapter 377-416, HE. Ogbody is engaged to a man who wants to break the engagement, but can't, because his older brother is a traditionalist who doesn't want to break the promise between families. Her mission is to pursue the older brother (ML) that ogbody secretly liked and stay with him for life. I surprisingly really liked this, especially the war arc!! hes rlly cold when hes not in love, but once he falls....girl he FALLS. They're super cute heehehhe, the 'what happens after the ending' scene got me crying🥹<img alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f622.png" style="height: 1em;" /> 9/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Nine: Cultivating a loyal dog boyfriend. Chapter 417-467, HE. Ogbody is an agent, and her trash bf is her signed artist, who cheated and left her after he became famous due to her efforts, leading to depression and suicide. Her mission is to be filial to her parents and became a gold broker-lever agent, and, if possible, help the only person who spoke up for ogbody (ML) when trash bf ruined her reputation. CUTIESSSSS. but i just want a normal modern world<img alt="💔" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f494.png" style="height: 1em;" />, this has magic shit too. 8/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Ten: Deep Sea Mermaid. Chapter 468-506, HE. Ogbody jumped into the ocean to save trash bf, but trash bf chose to save another girl, leading to her being dragged to the deep seas by man-eating mermaids. Her mission is to go back alive from the deep seas of the mermaids, and then take revenge on trash bf by breaking his heart. This was so funny, especially the beginning of her attempt to escape<img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png" style="height: 1em;" />. When MC fake-cried for trash bf, and ML saw and thought she was crying for him and was like...'we are different species im sorry i cant return ur feelings...',,,,HELP. the misunderstandings. 9/10[/spoiler]

[spoiler]World Eleven: The elder sister-in-law is difficile. Chapter 507-545. Ogbody is ML's decreased older brother's wife and they're in a period of war, where she treats the injured ML like sh<em>iaattt</em>. Her mission is to repay the ML, and live in peace. i skipped a LOT of this one cuz it didnt seem interesting off the bat, sooo, the summary probably isnt that good, but the parts i did read was boringg. Boring ML tbh, the only reason he started being kind was cuz she turned out to be his childhood sweetheart....lol not interested. the rating is low but im biased so. take that as you will. 6/10[/spoiler]

stopped reading cuz it got boring lol....it actually got boring way before but i really wanted to finish it...but its too boring and long...CUZ TELL ME WHY RHIS HAS A THOUSAND CHAPTERS???

Note, some of the MLs in these worlds can be extremely pushy, which is ultimately why I even skipped a lot of worlds/rated them low, but some worlds (any worlds rated above 8) are still really good imo. You could even just read those and ignore the others. I have to say though, the MC builds this shit. More than the MLs, I quite like her, which is the only reason this got three stars, i was originally gonna give it two stars because the MLs were the most unidimensional MLs I've ever seen ( and even gross vibes in some worlds.......like..yall dont all have to be dark depressing possessive and a 'beast in bed'...you know that right? literally the only personality traits ffs....this is why i love world #5, he was different in a hot way #notliketheothergirls #restrainedandnotgonnatouchheruntilmarriagehesaid #andthensheflirtedandhefellapart #lolcute and also World #3 haha hes too cute in his delusions), but MC made me take a deep breath, take a step back, and I gave an extra star for her. But then she also started pissing me tf off....like the system has made a BIZZILIAN mistakes, and every time. EVERY. damn. TIME. ur suspicious of the ML's identity? ask system. the system says ML's just some non-dangerous guy? you immediately let your guard down. and then later one, oh wow!, turns out he was this powerful ass final boss!, who knew!??!?! ....The first time? okay, fair enough. But the second...the third...the forth.......the fifth....GIRL IMMA FUCKING JUMPPPP YOU.

Like, this really had the potential to be <em>good</em>, it was going so well, but then everything I liked about it just fell apart at some point.

Ignoring that rant, this is fun to read as a pass time, and unless you're expecting to get smth out of it, you probably won't lose anything reading this]]>

        <![CDATA[I don't care for the first and second world. I ended up liking the third world which was she is the substitute. In typical novels, she will take revenge on the mission target (the bastard that hurt the original body) and have a relationship with another male character (True ML). In this third arc, our protagonist ends up with the target person. I loved it so much to the point it was so amusing. It's quite a surprise she didn't pick another male lead especially that gamer guy who also likes her. I thought he was the true male lead, but our protagonist proved me wrong. I wish there were more chapters and I want closure for this arc.

Every arc ends abruptly, which is what I dislike about this. If you want to know who the male lead is for every arc, it is most likely the powerful one.

It took so long for me to read it until the extra chapters. I didn't expect it to have many arcs. You would think it's done but she kept going world to world. It's still incomplete since I only read up to extra chapter 2.]]>
