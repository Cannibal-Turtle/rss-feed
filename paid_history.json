    "description": "【Delicate, soft, pretty little shou × paranoid, psychotic villain gong】\nDark room, forced confinement, obsessive pampering.\nShen Yu has bound to a system. His task is to enter various mission worlds and stop anomalous data from causing a world collapse.\nHe’s been completing the missions beautifully, except… the process seems a bit off—\nA mentally unstable financial magnate, eyes blood-red, holds him by the waist on the bed and murmurs hoarsely: “Don’t go.”\nA top award-winning actor bends close, lowering his head to drop a kiss by his ear: “You really are beautiful like this.”\nThe sound of metal chains clatters—\nThe chieftain of a beautiful sea-serpent race coils around his trembling, tearful body…\nIt’s 1v1. Sweet, sweet, sweet.",
