      <description><![CDATA[【Quick Transmigration + Double Male Leads + Cannon Fodder Counterattack + Main Shou + 1v1 + Double Clean】
The Lord God got scammed in an online relationship!
The other party even ran off on the way to meet in person!
Enraged, the Lord God issued a special-class wanted order, determined to drag back the wife who suddenly disappeared on him.
......
Xie Yaochen, who has already hidden himself inside a small world to carry out missions, blinks innocently.
“Dating? Never done that.”
“Online dating scam? No idea.”
“Special-class wanted criminal? Don’t know him either.”
Bound to a cannon fodder counterattack system, he happily travels through various small worlds. While cleaning up idiots, he even starts a sweet romance on the side.
His boyfriend is tall and handsome and loves him so much. If certain parts of him didn’t keep making him see that damn dog Lord God, it would be perfect...
Damn dog:

      <description><![CDATA[【Delicate, soft, pretty little shou × paranoid, psychotic villain gong】
Dark room, forced confinement, obsessive pampering.
Shen Yu is bound to a system. His task is to enter various mission worlds and stop anomalous data from causing the worlds' collapse.
He’s been completing the missions beautifully, except… the process seems a bit off—
A mentally unstable financial magnate, eyes blood-red, holds him by the waist on the bed and murmurs hoarsely: “Don’t go.”
A top award-winning actor bends close, lowering his head to drop a kiss by his ear: “You really are beautiful like this.”
The sound of metal chains clatters—
The chieftain of a beautiful sea-serpent race coils around his trembling, tearful body…
It’s 1v1. Sweet, sweet, sweet.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder’s script, Sheng Nuan is terrified…
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: “Nuan Nuan, you’re not allowed to go anywhere except by my side…”
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: “Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?”
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: “Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon.”
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: “Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me.”
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked…]]></description>
