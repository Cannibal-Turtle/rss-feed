      <description><![CDATA[【Quick Transmigration + Double Male Leads + Cannon Fodder Counterattack + Main Shou + 1v1 + Double Clean】
The Lord God got scammed in an online relationship!
The other party even ran off on the way to meet in person!
Enraged, the Lord God issued a special-class wanted order, determined to drag back the wife who suddenly disappeared on him.
......
Xie Yaochen, who has already hidden himself inside a small world to carry out missions, blinks innocently.
“Dating? Never done that.”
“Online dating scam? No idea.”
“Special-class wanted criminal? Don’t know him either.”
Bound to a cannon fodder counterattack system, he happily travels through various small worlds. While cleaning up idiots, he even starts a sweet romance on the side.
His boyfriend is tall and handsome and loves him so much. If certain parts of him didn’t keep making him see that damn dog Lord God, it would be perfect...

      <title>After Transmigrating into the Villain, I Got a HE with the Female Lead's Older Brother</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Calm, domineering CEO gong vs transmigrated clever shou【transmigration + 1v1 + double clean + sweet pampering】
Song Wan fell gravely ill. Rescue efforts failed, and he died.
When he opened his eyes again, he transmigrated into an abusive, dog-blood romance novel, becoming the villain who shared his exact name, the one who kept sabotaging the male and female leads’ romance.
To prevent the novel villain’s tragic ending from landing on his own head, Song Wan decided to turn over a new leaf.
Just like the system Siri said, the original host had committed too many evil deeds, which was why his ending was so miserable. As long as he did not block the male and female leads from falling in love and did not target the male lead, then it would be fine—
Fine my ass!
Other people transmigrated into the beginning or the middle of the story. He was practically about to transmigrate straight into the grand finale!
The original owner had done every bad thing imaginable and had even drugged the male lead, intending to destroy the male lead’s chastity.
This was bad! Song Wan’s vision went black. He took off in a hundred-meter sprint. Even if he had to kick the door down, he had to rescue the male lead from the hotel room laced with aphrodisiacs.
But the moment the door opened and Song Wan crashed headfirst into the sofa, he froze.
What was going on?
The one who had been drugged in the room was not the male lead at all. How was it the female lead’s brother instead!!!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder’s script, Sheng Nuan is terrified…
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: “Nuan Nuan, you’re not allowed to go anywhere except by my side…”
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: “Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?”
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: “Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon.”
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: “Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me.”
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked…]]></description>

Dark room, forced confinement, obsessive pampering.
Shen Yu is bound to a system. His task is to enter various mission worlds and stop anomalous data from causing the worlds' collapse.
He’s been completing the missions beautifully, except… the process seems a bit off—
A mentally unstable financial magnate, eyes blood-red, holds him by the waist on the bed and murmurs hoarsely: “Don’t go.”
A top award-winning actor bends close, lowering his head to drop a kiss by his ear: “You really are beautiful like this.”
The sound of metal chains clatters—
The chieftain of a beautiful sea-serpent race coils around his trembling, tearful body…
It’s 1v1. Sweet, sweet, sweet.]]></description>
